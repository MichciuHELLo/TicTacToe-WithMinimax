---- Tic Tac Toe - With MiniMax algorithm ----
----------------------------------------------

Game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal,
horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

3. Player vs Hard Computer:

 - Game counts points for your wins and wins of your opponent.
 - When Reset button is clicked you can choose again if you want to start ( keeps all the points as it was ).


About MiniMax algorithm:

Minimax is a decision rule used in game theory for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for n-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves.

Hard Computer looking for the best move for him throught all of the avaible spots on the table.
It counts all of the possibilities how the game may look in the future.
